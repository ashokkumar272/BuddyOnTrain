# City-Based Buddy Matching Implementation

## Overview
The buddy matching system has been enhanced to suggest travel companions not only from the exact same station but also from the same city. This means users can find more potential travel buddies by matching people traveling from different stations within the same city.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Utility Module (`backend/utils/railwayStations.js`)
Created a comprehensive utility module that provides:
- `loadRailwayStations()`: Loads the railway stations data from JSON file
- `findCityByStationCode(stationCode)`: Finds which city a station belongs to
- `getStationCodesForCity(cityName)`: Gets all station codes for a specific city
- `getAllStationCodesForMatchingCities(stationCode)`: Gets all stations in the same city as the given station
- `getStationDetails(stationCode)`: Gets detailed information about a station
- `searchStations(query, limit)`: Searches stations by name, code, or city
- `getAllCities()`: Gets list of all available cities

### 2. Enhanced User Controller (`backend/controllers/userController.js`)
Updated the `findTravelBuddies` function to:
- Use city-based matching instead of exact station matching
- Find all stations in the same city as the search criteria
- Prioritize exact station matches over city matches in results
- Include additional travel details in the response
- Provide search information showing which stations were considered

#### Key Changes:
- Import the railway stations utility functions
- Generate regex patterns for all stations in the matching cities
- Add `matchType` field to distinguish between 'exact' and 'city' matches
- Sort results to show exact matches first
- Include more detailed travel information in response

### 3. Enhanced Station Controller (`backend/controllers/stationController.js`)
Refactored to use the new utility functions and added new endpoints:
- `getStationSuggestions()`: Enhanced search with better city-based grouping
- `getStationByCode()`: New endpoint to get station details by code
- `getCityByStation()`: New endpoint to get city information by station code

### 4. Updated Station Routes (`backend/routes/stationRoute.js`)
Added new routes:
- `GET /api/stations/station/:stationCode`: Get station details
- `GET /api/stations/city-by-station/:stationCode`: Get city by station code

## How It Works

### Example Scenario:
If User A is traveling from **New Delhi (NDLS)** to **Mumbai Central (MMCT)** on a specific date, the system will now find buddies who are traveling:

**From Delhi (any station):**
- Old Delhi (DLI)
- New Delhi (NDLS) 
- Delhi Cantt (DEC)
- Delhi Sarai Rohilla (DEE)
- Delhi Shahdara (DSA)
- Anand Vihar Terminal (ANVT)
- Hazrat Nizamuddin (NZM)
- Sarai Rohilla (SZM)

**To Mumbai (any station):**
- Mumbai Central (MMCT)
- Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminal (CSMT)
- Lokmanya Tilak Terminal (LTT)
- Bandra Terminus (BDTS)
- Dadar Western (DDR)
- Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Intl Airport (CLA)
- Borivali (BVI)

### Response Format:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "count": 5,
  "data": [
    {
      "_id": "user123",
      "username": "traveler1",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "profession": "Engineer", 
      "bio": "Love to travel",
      "isFriend": false,
      "matchType": "exact", // or "city"
      "travelDetails": {
        "boardingStation": "NDLS",
        "destinationStation": "MMCT", 
        "trainNumber": "12951",
        "preferredClass": "3A",
        "travelDate": "2025-06-25T00:00:00.000Z"
      }
    }
  ],
  "searchInfo": {
    "fromStations": ["DLI", "NDLS", "DEC", "DEE", "DSA", "ANVT", "NZM", "SZM"],
    "toStations": ["MMCT", "CSMT", "LTT", "BDTS", "DDR", "CLA", "BVI"],
    "exactMatches": 2,
    "cityMatches": 3
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **More Buddy Suggestions**: Users can find more potential travel companions
2. **Flexible Matching**: Even if exact stations don't match, city-level matching provides alternatives
3. **Prioritized Results**: Exact station matches are shown first, followed by city matches  
4. **Better User Experience**: More relevant suggestions increase the chances of finding compatible travel buddies
5. **Same Date Requirement**: Maintains the exact date matching requirement for safety

## Testing

A test file `test-city-matching.js` has been created to verify the functionality. Run it with:
```bash
cd backend
node test-city-matching.js
```

The test demonstrates how the city-based matching works with real examples from the railway stations data.
